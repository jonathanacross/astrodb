20171028-01-m31	2017-10-28	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 31|M 32	10:12	Plossl 25mm	30x		Very faint--have to use averted vision to see anything but the core.  M32 looks like a star
20171028-02-cr399	2017-10-28	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Cr 399	10:40	Plossl 25mm	30x		Much brighter than in binoculars - this part of the sky is pretty bright because of the moon and a football game.
20171028-03-albireo	2017-10-28	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Beta Cyg	10:53	Paradigm 8mm	94x		A: bigger, light orange. B: smaller, light blue.

20171210-02-m57	2017-12-10	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 57	7:30	Plossl 25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Can barely make out a ring with averted vision -- else just a light blur.
20171220-01-m39	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 39	8:22	Plossl 25mm	30x		Nice triangular-shaped open cluster. Stars are very crisp and clear and bright.
20171220-02-m37	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 37	9:18	Plossl 25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Very faint, with averted vision seems like a speckle of stars.
20171220-03-davisdog	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	10x50 Binoculars	G	3	Davis's Dog	9:52				Looks like 73 to me.
20171220-04-almach	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Gamma And	10:30	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Primary is a light orange. Secondary is blue (rather deep blue for a star); much fainter. Nice double!
20180103-01-uranus	2018-01-03	Bellevue at home	9x50 Finderscope	F	3	Uranus	9:52				White/pale blue. Looks like a big star, but not as bright.
20180103-02-iotacas	2018-01-03	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Iota Cas	10:23	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Supposedly a triple star.  Yes, in finderscope this appears as 3 stars clumped together. :)
20180103-03-rigel	2018-01-03	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Beta Ori	10:39	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Double star. Secondary is very faint, just outside the bright sparkle of the primary. Can see hints of the diffraction patterns due to the spider.
20180113-01-m77	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	M 77	9:00	Plossl 25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Kind of a pear shape of faint nebulosity - slightly sparkly.
20180113-02-castor	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	Alpha Gem	9:37	Paradigm 8mm + 2x barlow	188x		Can see separation between primary and secondary, but lots of noise around the stars. This is a 6-star system, I believe.
20180113-03-m45	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	M 45	10:36	Plossl 25mm	30x		No nebulosity, but very sharp, bright stars.
20180113-04-betamon	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	Beta Mon	11:11	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Can't tell which of the close pair is primary; equal brightness. Both are white. Note: if I had better luck and a higher magnification, should be a triple star.
20180114-01-m38	2018-01-14	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3-	M 38	8:05	Plossl 25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Smaller than I expected. Lots more stars (not shown) with averted vision. General pentagon shape. Shaded ovals show areas with many smaller dimmer stars.
20180114-02-mucep	2018-01-14	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3-	Mu Cep	8:23	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Light orange color. Really stands out.

20180114-04-m42	2018-01-14	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3-	M 42|M 43	9:49	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Nebulosity is brightest near the trapezium (see 4 stars) and the row of 3. Also some about the star farther down (M43). Very pretty.
20180114-05-ngc2264	2018-01-14	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3-	NGC 2264	10:19	Plossl 25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Looks like a Christmas tree!
20180129-01-145cma	2018-01-29	Bellevue at home	10x50 Binoculars	G	3-	145 CMa	10:58				Double. Both appear pale orange.

20180211-01-cheshire	2018-02-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Smiley Face	11:39	Plossl 25mm	30x		Found this pretty fast today - aimed the red dot finder where I thought it would be, and there it was in the scope!
20180211-02-sigmaori	2018-02-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Sigma Ori	11:47	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Very cool - I like the two pairs of doubles in the view. :)
20180212-01-11cam	2018-02-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	11-12 Cam	10:08	Plossl 25mm	30x		A: white, maybe a hint of blue. B: very pale orange. Pretty double, tricky to find in LP skies.

20180212-03-m41	2018-02-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 41	10:40	Plossl 25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Hints of more (much fainter) stars with averted vision. Stars are well spread out.
20180212-04-rigel	2018-02-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Beta Ori	11:05	Paradigm 8mm	94x		Lots of nebulosity around the primary. Secondary is faint but distinct pin prick.
20180212-05-m44	2018-02-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 44	11:37	Plossl 25mm	30x		Lots of very bright white stars. Fairly spread out.
20180212-06-ceres	2018-02-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	(1) Ceres	12:32	Plossl 25mm	30x		Just a white dot. Other stars for reference. A: 66 CnC, B: 63 CnC
20180220-01-funnel	2018-02-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	4	Funnel	10:15	Plossl 25mm + 2x barlow	60x		All stars are white, approx same brightness. Sky is washed out here, so contrast could be better. Somewhat faint.
20180220-02-arrowhead	2018-02-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	4	Arrowhead	10:53	Paradigm 8mm	94x		No color in stars.

20180305-02-m81	2018-03-05	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 81	11:01	Zoom 8mm	94x		Center much brighter than the rest, although entire galaxy disappears without averted vision.
20180305-03-m3	2018-03-05	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 3	11:46	Zoom 8mm	94x		Brighter in the center. Can't resolve any stars. Whole thing is fairly bright. No averted vision needed.
20180311-01-ngc2244	2018-03-11	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	F	7	NGC 2244	10:15	Plossl 25mm	30x		Looks like a hexagon with a heart on top. Many more stars not drawn.
20180311-02-m67	2018-03-11	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	F	7	M 67	10:45	Zoom 8mm	94x		Concentrated stars at the center. Almost seems like a hint of nebulosity. One bright star.
20180311-03-leotriplet	2018-03-11	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	F	7	M 65|M 66|NGC 3628	11:05	Zoom 20mm	38x		A: M66 - seems the brightest. Bright core, roundish. B: M65 - slightly dimmer and more eccentric. Also bright core. C: NGC 3628 - looks edge-on. Much fainter, only visible with averted vision. No core.
20180311-04-m51	2018-03-11	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	F	7	M 51|NGC 5195	11:30	Zoom 8mm	94x		Clearly two galaxies, with brighter cores.  Appear face-on. Slight separation between them. Hint that they may be connected at the top.
20180314-01-ngc2281	2018-03-14	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	NGC 2281	11:16	Zoom 8mm	94x		Nice snake-shaped sequence of stars in the center.

20180319-03-ngc2392	2018-03-19	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3-	NGC 2392	11:17	Zoom 8mm + 2x barlow	188x		Circular. Brighter center. Looks like a star at lower magnification. Took four attempts to find this!
20180319-04-inchworm	2018-03-19	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3-	Inchworm	11:51	Zoom 24mm	31x		Looks like an inchworm. Direction a little hard to determine accurately since near zenith and scope is slipping a little.
20180320-01-m3	2018-03-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 3	11:45	Zoom 8mm + 2x barlow	188x		Nice little globular cluster. Can't resolve any stars. Center is brighter.

20180422-05-jupiter	2018-04-22	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3-	Jupiter	11:55	Zoom 8mm + 2x barlow	188x		Drawn slightly larger than actually appears in the view. Two bands are obvious, a third, polar band is visible for certain instants of time. Bands are light brown. Supposedly should see the shadow of Io, but no luck.
20180506-01-venus	2018-05-06	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	2	Venus	9:23	Zoom 8mm	94x		Very bright, can't use high power since telescope not cooled. Can see that it's gibbous.
20180511-01-m13	2018-05-11	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	VG	6	M 13	12:05	Zoom 8mm	94x		Very large and bright. Generally spherical, but appears to have a few chains of stars coming out on the sides.

20180530-02-m53	2018-05-30	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	P	3-	M 53	10:47	SLV 5mm	150x		Just a gray patch, slightly brighter in the center
20180530-03-jupiter	2018-05-30	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	P	3-	Jupiter	10:58	SLV 5mm	150x		Surprisingly clear, given that I was looking through a cloud! Can see two large bands, bottom band looks darker, and another faint band near the top.
20180601-01-polaris	2018-06-01	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	4	Alpha UMi	11:01	SLV 5mm	150x		Secondary star is easily separated, but much dimmer. Compass directions are approximate based on the location of the diamond ring in the finderscope.

20180702-03-m18	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 18	12:06	Zoom 12mm	63x		Hard to tell where the boundary of this cluster is. Nice pentagon in the middle. Curious if there would be lots more stars in a darker sky; I don't see many really faint ones.
20180702-04-m21	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 21	12:23	Zoom 8mm	94x		Slight concentration of stars near the center.

Seems brighter and with averted vision sometimes see a small disc around it.  B: position seems more correct, but looks sharper, more star-like. [Yes, confirmed with Stellarium that A is the PN.]

20180711-04-m11	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 11	12:43	SLV 5mm	150x		Lots of fairly faint stars -- too many to draw accurately. At lower powers this looks like a faint globular.
20180711-05-m10	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 10	1:16	SLV 5mm	150x		Very dim. Stars resolve with averted vision, with direct vision it's just a lighter gray patch
20180711-06-m9	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 9	1:29	SLV 5mm	150x		Very faint gray patch. Hint of some stars with averted vision.  Have to shake the telescope to find this. Slight brighter in the core.

20180712-05-m8	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 8	11:49	Zoom 8mm	94x		Nice open cluster; a few bright stars and many very faint ones. Some slight nebulosity visible next to the star on the left.  Not as impressive as at the darker site, but still pretty cool.
20180712-06-m21	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 21	11:59	Zoom 8mm	94x		Very open cluster. Not too many stars.

20180806-02-ngc6709	2018-08-06	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	2	NGC 6709	11:29	SLV 5mm	150x		Nice bright triangle of stars on the east. Other stars are fairly faint. No central core of stars.
20180807-01-ngc6826	2018-08-07	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	NGC 6826	10:37	SLV 5mm	150x		Round and fuzzy, bright in the middle. Does get dimmer when I look straight at it. With Zoom 8mm EP, this was even more striking, where it would almost completely disappear with straight vision and get very bright with averted vision. Very cool. :)
20180807-02-m22	2018-08-07	Sammamish HS	Meade Infinity 80	G	3	M 22	11:51	Zoom 8mm	50x		Fairly large. Faint. Slightly brighter in the center. Hints of stars with averted vision.

20180817-02-ngc654	2018-08-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	NGC 654	11:26	SLV 5mm	150x		Hints of more faint stars within the quadrilateral, esp. near the right point, but only have vague glimpses of them.
20180817-03-ngc869ngc884	2018-08-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	NGC 869|NGC 884	11:39	HD60 25mm	30x		Spectacular! Stars look like 2 piles of diamonds. NGC 884 (right) looks a bit like a ring, where NGC 864 like a very sparse, fully split globular.

With more averted vision can see 3 stars, can't see if there are any more.
20180901-04-m110	2018-09-01	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	G	7-	M 110	12:08	Zoom 18mm	42x		See a very faint blur near M 31. Suspect it may be M 110. Very soft, looks taller than wide. Maybe slightly brighter in the core.  The large glow of M 31 is visible in the south of the view.

20180903-04-ngc7662	2018-09-03	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	4	NGC 7662	11:30	SLV 5mm	150x		Round, white, concentrated blur. Maybe not as soft as a globular. Slightly brighter in the center.

20181017-01-rupesrecta	2018-10-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Rupes Recta	10:13-10:29	SLV 5mm	150x	8 day moon	Rupes Recta (straight wall) is a very prominent vertical line, fairly straight and dark. Thebit has a very dark edge on one side, light on the other. Looks deep. Thebit A looks deep but smaller (bowl-shaped?) Thebit L is very small - just a dot.
20181017-02-delaunay	2018-10-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Delaunay	10:33-10:48	SLV 5mm	150x	8 day moon	Delaunay looks like it's cloven in two with a hill/mountain across the middle. Top half is dark gray to gray, and the bottom is gray to light gray.

At 9:38:43, the star just blinks out, instantly gone.  First detected reappearance at 10:33:14. Couldn't detect that Gamma Cap emerged for probably 20-25 seconds from the predicted time since the moon and clouds were so bright. The star was relatively small and dim. Still very cool to see, and the star "moved away" from the moon surprisingly fast.
20181019-01-clavius	2018-10-19	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Clavius|Clavius craterlets	9:53-10:24	SLV 5mm	150x	10 day moon	Clavius has a smooth looking interior, with nice chains of craters inside.

Trapezium stars have tiny diffraction rings; can't see any other components (E/F). A treat, but a pain to sketch. Theta2 - both white, similarly bright, though star on the left is the primary.
20181118-06-struve747iotaori	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	Struve 747|Iota Ori	11:17	Zoom 8mm	94x		A,B are Struve 747. A is slightly brighter. Both white. C is iota-Ori, can see much dimmer secondary. All white.  Nice open cluster!

At 250x appears as a round flat fuzzy ball. Hints of ring structure, no CS. UHC: slightly brighter, ring structure a little more apparent. Wish I had a higher power eyepiece for this. OIII. visible, but everything too dark.
20210906-02-ngc7009	2021-09-06	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3	NGC 7009	10:45	Delos 4.5mm	250x		Star hopped here starting from Saturn! Bright, star-like at 40x. No filter: fuzzy, oval shaped, center slightly brighter. Easy with direct vision. No CS. UHC: much brighter, but no more detail.

20210906-04-ngc7293	2021-09-06	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3	NGC 7293	11:45	Delos 12mm+UHC	94x		Invisible with no filter and with UHC filter. OIII: large, extremely faint ring visible, averted vision only. No CS seen. However, going back to no filter I can see the CS. Increasing the magnitude to 141x helps; can see both the PN and the CS with the OIII filter. Cool. I want darker skies to see this again. :)
20210906-05-stf3060	2021-09-06	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3+	STF 3060 ABCD	12:16	Delos 4.5mm	250x		A, B close, but easily split (even split at 94x). A, B, about equal magnitude.  C is very faint, only seen with averted vision. D is bright.
20210908-01-ngc7026	2021-09-08	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3	NGC 7026	9:08	Delos 4.5mm+UHC	250x		No filter: seen clearly at 141x with averted vision. At 250x, invisible with direct vision, but averted vision shows a bright small ball concentrated in the center, like a tiny globular. PN is right next to a star of about equal magnitude. With UHC: significantly brighter, a little bigger, seen with direct vision. Center is very bright, I think it is the CS. :)
20210908-02-ic1369	2021-09-08	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3+	IC 1369	9:33	Delos 4.5mm	250x		Has about 10 brighter star, another 10 medium ones, and a concentrated center of fainter stars. Est class I 3 m.

20210913-02-ngc40	2021-09-13	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	F	3+	NGC 40	9:29	Delos 4.5mm	250x		No filter: appears as a light halo around a star at 141x. Relatively bright, but averted vision required. At 250x, is a little more defined. Interior is ever so slightly brighter than the background, and a ring is evident. UHC: brightens up the interior quite a bit, making the ring harder to see.

Brightish center - maybe the CS? and a fainter haze around it. Adding a UHC filter brightens it considerably at the center, almost like a small ball. Suspect that I'm not seeing the CS, since it got so much brighter, and the CS at mag 15.6 is too dim to see with this scope.

20220306-01-m40	2022-03-06	Bellevue at home	10x50 Binoculars	G	3+	M 40	9:48				Just a faint, slightly fuzzy point that flickers at the edge of detectability. See about 20% of the time. (The star A is magnitude 8 and can be held in the view with averted vision.) Not able to see here as a double, though it should be splittable. Just a bit too dim to see the components clearly.

A UHC filter brings it out just enough that I thought I could detect it. OIII darkens the sky enough that it's only "very faint" with averted vision. Appears as a soft gray circle. No detail or central star. In a nice asterism of a triangle of stars.

UHC view is similar.  At 94x, using OIII, see a very faint glow, but more clearly defined. At this point, suspect the views at 141x were of a passing cloud.

Cool to see the star in the Pleiades appear as dusk falls - numbers indicate order in which they appeared.  Clouds over 50%-90% of the sky but amazingly this part of the sky stayed mostly clear. 9:06: can see Mercury naked eye (first time!), about 10 degrees above the horizon, WNW.  9:28: faintest hints of M 45 with averted vision naked eye.

Peak on left is bright white: the tip of Mons Hadley, which has two additional smaller peaks. To the right is Mons Hadley Delta, with a curved shadow. At the base of the mountain is the site of the Apollo 15 mission. The Apollo 15 mission (on the moon July 30, 1971) was to study the Hadly-Apienne region.  It was the first of the Apollo "J" missions capable of a longer stay time on the moon and greater surface mobility.  It set several new records for crewed spaceflight: heaviest payload in a lunar orbit (about 107,000 pounds), maximum radial distance traveled on the lunar surface away from the spacecraft (about 17.5 miles), and longest total of duration for lunar surface EVAs (18 hours, 37 minutes).

OIII filter is similar. Upping the magnification to 188x + UHC makes this easier.  Small, faint, star-like, averted vision only.

A bit easier at 188x, still mostly averted vision, as it tends to blink out with direct. UHC brightens this somewhat. Part of a 6-point dolphin asterism.

Increasing magnification actually makes this harder to see. Lowering to 94x+OIII brings this out a bit more. Can see a faint ring structure. Still averted vision only. No CS.

UHC and OIII filters have no effect. Believe the PN is behind a star (or CS is bright and the rest of the nebula is dim). Many other field stars not drawn. When looking directly at the star, can see a small faint diffraction ring (other stars with similar magnitude show this, too). With averted vision, the area around the star looks a little brighter. While I also see this with some other stars (likely diffraction due to my curved spider vanes) this star shows it a bit more than the others. So maybe I am seeing the PN.  Note that B+30 3639 is an alternate name of the variable star V1966 Cyg; The PN is actually ARO 11 or PK 064+05.1.

20220718-04-ngc6891	2022-07-18	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	5	NGC 6891	1:22	Delos 3.5mm	321x		Looks stellar at lower power (141x). At 188x, could see hints that the PN was not stellar. Adding UHC shows a tiny disc, no detail. Increasing mag to 321x unfiltered shows the best view. Can see barely with direct vision. Bright center, see CS with averted vision, then a lighter disk on the outside.
20220718-05-ngc6905	2022-07-18	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	5	NGC 6905	1:53	Delos 6mm+UHC	188x		At 141x, easily seen gray disc (averted vision only). Responds well to both UHC and OIII filters. At 188x, see a flat disc, but sometimes see hints of some structure (a ring? not sure) No CS.
20220718-06-ngc6881	2022-07-18	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	4	NGC 6881	2:38	Delos 3.5mm+UHC	321x		Not seen at 141x, either unfiltered nor with UHC. See a faint hint of a star in the right spot at 250x (no filter). 321x makes it a little easier, (still faint, stellar), and adding a UHC confirms it by brightening it a little bit.
20220719-01-ngc6742	2022-07-19	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3+	NGC 6742	10:42	Delos 4.5mm+UHC	250x		Invisible without a filter. UCH reveals a faint gray patch. Somewhat amorphous. No CS seen. Averted vision only. Best seen when I nudge the scope.

Similar, but darker with an OIII. At 250x + UHC see a soft dot clearly with averted vision. No CS, but center is brighter, edges slightly fuzzy.
20220723-02-ic1295	2022-07-23	Sammamish HS	Dobstuff 10	G	3	IC 1295	11:48	Delos 8mm+OIII	141x		Not seen without a filter. At 141x, adding UHC reveals the faintest hint of a glow at  the edge of detection. With OIII this brightens considerably. Still averted vision only. No CS. Soft, med size gray patch. A little amorphous, but no structure seen.
20220723-03-ic4846	2022-07-23	Sammamish HS	Dobstuff 10	G	3	IC 4846	12:12	Delos 4.5mm+UHC	250x		Seen at 141x. Appears stellar with averted vision. At 250x, still stellar, averted vision. Adding UHC brightens this a bit to confirm which dot is the PN.
20220723-04-ngc6751	2022-07-23	Sammamish HS	Dobstuff 10	G	3	NGC 6751	12:23	Delos 3.5mm	321x		Quite near V Aql, which has a great saturated orange color. See at 141x with averted vision as a fairly bright, small fuzzy dot (no filter). At 250x, almost direct vision. Center is brighter, and outside fainter like an unresolved globular.  UHC and OIII both brighten the outside; prefer unfiltered view. At 321x, is a soft cotton ball, fuzzy edges, direct vision. Hints of a CS sometimes. :)

At 321x, no filter, see medium bright fuzzy ball. Faint with direct vision. With averted vision, I can see a faint ring, and (I think) a CS. UHC makes the PN bigger and brighter, but details are harder to see. Like unfiltered better.

At 188x, nicely framed in the view at the center of a square of stars. Large and diffuse. Two lobes in a fat dumbbell shape. Direct vision, no CS. Adding UHC brightens the PN, showing an apple-core center in an oval outside. OIII: darker, but can see some structure: faint filaments coming out from the apple core. Bit of a toss up whether UHC or OIII is better here. My wife's comment: "Oh,that's amazing! No wonder you spend hours looking at the stars!"

At 250x larger, but still averted vision. A UHC brings this out well, OIII even more but generally too dark. With UHC, has a general ring structure, but is brighter on the N side - almost a blob there - slightly brighter on the S, and dimmer on the E side. Right next to a double star. No CS seen. Very cool.

20220805-03-pease1	2022-08-05	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	VG	4+	Pease 1	12:37-1:23	Delos 3.5mm	321x		Spent about 45 minutes attempting to see Pease 1. This time I have my equatorial platform, which helps substantially. Stayed completely hooded, and successfully got the blinking technique down. UHC filter may work better since the view is not quite so dim. Unfortunately, can't detect any brightening yet. But can see the locating asterisms and a small dot where the PN should be.

Red fringe on the top, blue on the bottom (like a refractor) due to atmospheric refraction. One band toward the N side, slightly darker brown. Cassini Division faintly seen as a darker color through the rings. See shadow of Saturn on the rings, and sometimes the shadow of the rings on Saturn.

At 250x, is brighter but still averted vision only. Center is almost stellar, and can see a faint gray haze around it. Responds some to UHC and quite a bit to an OIII filter, though the latter darkens the view too much. OIII reveals that the bright cluster is the PN and not a CS.
20220816-02-ic5117	2022-08-16	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	4	IC 5117	11:16	Delos 3.5mm	321x		Seen at 141x as stellar, with averted vision. Blinks out with direct vision, while nearby stars do not. Still stellar at 321x; still only averted vision. Responds well to a UHC filter; appears brighter than the star next to it.
20220816-03-m179	2022-08-16	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	4	M 1-79	11:53	Delos 6mm+OIII	188x		At 141x, invisible without a filter. Using a UHC, see a very faint small glow. OIII filter brightens this more. At 188x + OIII, appears as a faint gray disc. No CS or detail. Still rather faint.

Required a minute or two of study before I could see this. Stars are elusive; I can't hold them in vision, they blink in and out. Hard to draw accurately. Est class I 2 p.
20220822-03-king19	2022-08-22	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	4 (clear dark sky)	King 19	11:28	Delos 3.5mm	321x		Very near NGC 7510; could see them both in the view at 141x. K19 is sparse, wide variety of magnitudes, about 15 stars. Est class III 3 p.

At 250x, see a lighter patch occasionally when moving the scope. Increasing the magnitude to 321x help; see a stellar core with slight nebulosity, still very hard to see.
20220824-02-ngc7129	2022-08-24	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	F	3	NGC 7129	10:56	Delos 6mm+UHC	188x		Faint nebulosity around a sparse cluster of stars. Nebulosity disappears without the UHC filter.

K9: very small and faint. Can't resolve stars clearly; sort of a misty slightly-sparkly patch. Concentrated. Est class I 2 m.
20220828-05-ngc7635	2022-08-28	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	5	NGC 7635	11:40	Delos 6mm+OIII	188x		At 188x, no filter: invisible. Responds a little to a UHC filter; see some faint nebulosity around a star. Adding OIII filter is even better. See a nice ring around the star. CS is bright, can see with direct vision. PN requires averted vision. Increasing power makes the view too dim. :)
20220828-06-ngc7423	2022-08-28	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	5	NGC 7423	12:16	Delos 3.5mm	321x		Extremely faint glow. Very small. No stars resolved, but slight speckled appearance. Somewhat concentrated. Est class II 2 m.  Star marked M is magnitude 14.1, near edge of detection.

Appears stellar. Responds well to a UHC filter, and even more with OIII. Unfiltered, was dimmer than nearby star N, now is brighter. Always just stellar.
20220905-03-abell82	2022-09-05	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	4 (clear, cool, dark considering gibbous moon)	Abell 82	11:44	Delos 4.5mm+UHC	250x		At 188x, invisible without a filter and with UHC. Faint hint of a glow with OIII. At 250x, only seen with UHC; invisible unfiltered and too dark with OIII. Located towards one side of a rhombus of stars. Can see a faint CS with averted vision, and when moving the scope, a faint glow around it. No detail.

Careful examination shows the shape of the planet + rings (circle + ellipse). Cannot see the space between the rings and the planet.
20220918-01-dna	2022-09-18	Sammamish HS	10x50 Binoculars	F	3 (pleasant, cool)	DNA	11:05				See 4 stars in a trapezoid. Hints of some fainter ones (6-7 total in the asterism). Need mag 5 skies to see all the other faint stars in the chain. A bit underwhelming. Bright 2 stars are 98, 99 Aqr, easy to find and see.
20220919-01-ngc659	2022-09-19	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	F	3.5	NGC 659	11:07	Delos 4.5mm	250x		About 12 brighter stars, maybe another 10 faint ones (say mag 12-13). Small concentrated, fairly bright seen as a slight blur at 40x. Est class II 2 p.

At 113x, no filter, can see 2 lobes, now easy to see with averted vision. At 188x, no filter can see the dumbbell shape with averted vision, and a nebulous glow with direct vision. UHC filter brings this out quite a bit, easier to see the shape. No CS seen. :)
20220919-04-ngc185	2022-09-19	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3.5	NGC 185	12:41	Delos 10mm	113x		Very faint and diffuse. Best seen when moving the scope.

20220925-05-ngc246	2022-09-25	Thorpe, WA	Dobstuff 10	G	7 (Bortle 3-4)	NGC 246	12:50	Delos 6mm+UHC	188x		Seen at 40x, no filter, as a glow around 3 stars. At 188x, unfiltered, see a faint diffuse glow with averted vision in a doughnut shape! UHC brings this out slightly; shape is more defined. CS is bright. See a ring, plus brighter towards the NW side. Interior is slightly brighter than backgrounds sky. Really amazing!

Adding a UHC filter brightens it quite a bit, though still averted vision only. At 188x + UHC, see a ring! Interior is brighter than the background field. No CS. Further magnification doesn't help. :)
20221113-01-tr2	2022-11-13	Bellevue at home	Dobstuff 10	G	3	Tr 2	10:21	Delos 6mm	188x		Nice bright cluster. Large magnitude difference between stars. Marked star i pale orange. About 40 stars. Est class II 3 p.

Generally didn't see much. However sometimes a very large (about the size of the entire FOV) seemed slightly lighter, or more opaque than the nearby sky. Not too convinced. After a while, with the OIII filter, I saw a slightly brighter triangular patch, able to see this repeatedly.  This is the second closest PN to Earth, 400ly.

UHC brings this out a bit, as well as other nebulosity to the N. Bright, generally circular, with a bright star in the center (hints of a double star, but seeing is bad), and obvious Y shaped dust lanes. Trying OIII filter, also pretty well defined, but a bit darker. UHC filter is better.  Wow! Sketched on black paper with conte crayon and gel pen.

Bright and visible in the finder scope. Pease 1: After several years and numerous attempts, finally saw this! Just a small dot in a particular place. Confirmed by blinking a UHC filter; the spot stayed brighter while everything else dimmed. Instructions from Cloudy Nights forum "Pease 1 using a 16" Lightbridge" for finding this were very helpful.  This took about an hour of effort to find/confirm/sketch.

Can't see eclipse in the telescope, but can see the sun dimly naked-eye through the clouds. 8:55: fast moving fog, can't see anything. 9:07: Clouds broken again. Moon almost covering up the last group of sunspots. Moon's disc is clearly smaller than the sun. (This is an annular eclipse in Oregon/Texas.) 9:20: Maximum eclipse, 85.8% covered. Near the max, the intersection points of the moon's and sun's edges rotate pretty fast. 9:49: Partially cloudy. Can see a new sunspot group through the clouds.  10:07: fairly thick clouds, difficult to see the sun. 10:26: can see sunspots again, barely. 10:39: end of eclipse. Still cloudy, can see the moon's disc exit.
