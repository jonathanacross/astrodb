20171028-01-m31	2017-10-28	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 31|M 32	10:12	25mm	30x		Very faint--have to use averted vision to see anything but the core.  M32 looks like a star
20171028-02-cr399	2017-10-28	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Cr 399	10:40	25mm	30x		Much brighter than in binoculars - this part of the sky is pretty bright because of the moon and a football game.
20171028-03-albireo	2017-10-28	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Beta Cyg	10:53	8mm	94x		A: bigger, light orange. B: smaller, light blue.
20171210-01-m34	2017-12-10	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 34	7:00	25mm	30x		Seems like a spiral of stars going in; faintest hint of nebulosity in the center (Didn't know about the name until after writing this description!)
20171210-02-m57	2017-12-10	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 57	7:30	25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Can barely make out a ring with averted vision -- else just a light blur.
20171220-01-m39	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 39	8:22	25mm	30x		Nice triangular-shaped open cluster. Stars are very crisp and clear and bright.
20171220-02-m37	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 37	9:18	25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Very faint, with averted vision seems like a speckle of stars.
20171220-03-davisdog	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	10x50 Binoculars	G	3	Davis's Dog	9:52				Looks like 73 to me.
20171220-04-almach	2017-12-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Gamma And	10:30	8mm	94x		Primary is a light orange. Secondary is blue (rather deep blue for a star); much fainter. Nice double!
20180103-01-uranus	2018-01-03	Bellevue at home	9x50 Finderscope	F	3	Uranus	9:52				White/pale blue. Looks like a big star, but not as bright.
20180103-02-iotacas	2018-01-03	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Iota Cas	10:23	8mm	94x		Supposedly a triple star.  Yes, in finderscope this appears as 3 stars clumped together. :)
20180103-03-rigel	2018-01-03	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Beta Ori	10:39	8mm	94x		Double star. Secondary is very faint, just outside the bright sparkle of the primary. Can see hints of the diffractions patterns due to the spider.
20180113-01-m77	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	M 77	9:00	25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Kind of a pear shape of faint nebulosity - slightly sparkly.
20180113-02-castor	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	Alpha Gem	9:37	8mm + 2x barlow	188x		Can see separation between primary and secondary, but lots of noise around the stars. This is a 6-star system, I believe.
20180113-03-m45	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	M 45	10:36	25mm	30x		No nebulosity, but very sharp, bright stars.
20180113-04-betamon	2018-01-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3+	Beta Mon	11:11	8mm	94x		Can't tell which of the close pair is primary; equal brightness. Both are white. Note: if I had better luck and a higher magnification, should be a triple star.
20180114-01-m38	2018-01-14	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3-	M 38	8:05	25mm + 2x barlow	60x		Smaller than I expected. Lots more stars (not shown) with averted vision. General pentagon shape. Shaded ovals show areas with many smaller dimmer stars.
20180114-02-mucep	2018-01-14	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3-	Mu Cep	8:23	8mm	94x		Light orange color. Really stands out.

20180211-01-cheshire	2018-02-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Smiley Face	11:39	25mm	30x		Found this pretty fast today - aimed the red dot finder where I thought it would be, and there it was in the scope!
20180211-02-sigmaori	2018-02-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Sigma Ori	11:47	8mm	94x		Very cool - I like the two pairs of doubles in the view. :)

20180319-04-inchworm	2018-03-19	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3-	Inchworm	11:51	24mm	31x		Looks like an inchworm. Direction a little hard to determine accurately since near zenith and scope is slipping a little.
20180320-01-m3	2018-03-20	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 3	11:45	8mm + 2x barlow	188x		Nice little globular cluster. Can't resolve any stars. Center is brighter.

Two bands are obvious, a third, polar band is visible for certain instants of time. Bands are light brown. Supposedly should see the shadow of Io, but no luck.
20180506-01-venus	2018-05-06	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	2	Venus	9:23	8mm	94x		Very bright, can't use high power since telescope not cooled. Can see that it's gibbous.
20180511-01-m13	2018-05-11	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	VG	6	M 13	12:05	8mm	94x		Very large and bright. Generally spherical, but appears to have a few chains of stars coming out on the sides.

20180530-02-m53	2018-05-30	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	P	3-	M 53	10:47	5mm	150x		Just a gray patch, slightly brighter in the center
20180530-03-jupiter	2018-05-30	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	P	3-	Jupiter	10:58	5mm	150x		Surprisingly clear, given that I was looking through a cloud! Can see two large bands, bottom band looks darker, and another faint band near the top.
20180601-01-polaris	2018-06-01	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	4	Alpha UMi	11:01	5mm	150x		Secondary star is easily separated, but much dimmer. Compass directions are approximate based on the location of the diamond ring in the finderscope.

20180702-03-m18	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 18	12:06	12mm	63x		Hard to tell where the boundary of this cluster is. Nice pentagon in the middle. Curious if there would be lots more stars in a darker sky; I don't see many really faint ones.
20180702-04-m21	2018-07-02	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	M 21	12:23	8mm	94x		Slight concentration of stars near the center.

20180707-02-mars	2018-07-07	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Mars	1:04	5mm	150x		Super bright orange. Very large. Not much detail.  Can see a whiter area on the N pole and a slightly darker area towards the south.
20180711-01-ngc6210	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	NGC 6210	11:45	8mm	94x		A: visually looks like it might be a planetary nebula. Seems brighter and with averted vision sometimes see a small disc around it.  B: position seems more correct, but looks sharper, more star-like. [Yes, confirmed with Stellarium that A is the PN.]
20180711-02-ic4756	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	IC 4756	12:08	25mm	30x		Lots of stars. No concentration. Very pretty. :)

20180711-04-m11	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 11	12:43	5mm	150x		Lots of fairly faint stars -- too many to draw accurately. At lower powers this looks like a faint globular.
20180711-05-m10	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 10	1:16	5mm	150x		Very dim. Stars resolve with averted vision, with direct vision it's just a lighter gray patch
20180711-06-m9	2018-07-11	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 9	1:29	5mm	150x		Very faint gray patch. Hint of some stars with averted vision.  Have to shake the telescope to find this. Slight brighter in the core.
20180712-01-m19	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 19	11:05	8mm	94x		Mostly just a faint smudge. Can see hints of stars with averted vision.
20180712-02-m80	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 80	11:21	8mm	94x		Very small, bright core. However with averted vision can see it's quite large and diffuse at the edges. I like this one! :)
20180712-03-betasco	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	Beta Sco	11:29	8mm	94x		Both stars are bright white. Primary is quite bright. Easy split.
20180712-04-m28	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 28	11:41	8mm	94x		Brighter core. Only the faintest hint of any stars with averted vision; mostly a smudge.
20180712-05-m8	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 8	11:49	8mm	94x		Nice open cluster; a few bright stars and many very faint ones. Some slight nebulosity visible next to the star on the left.  Not as impressive as at the darker site, but still pretty cool.
20180712-06-m21	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 21	11:59	8mm	94x		Very open cluster. Not too many stars.
20180712-07-m20	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 20	12:05	8mm	94x		Looks mostly like an open cluster. Possibly the faintest hint of nebulosity around the double star ear the center; the area is just slightly brighter.
20180712-08-m71	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 71	12:25	8mm	94x		Very faint. Core is not much brighter than the edges. Can see some stars with averted vision. Many faint stars everywhere in the field; too many to sketch
20180712-09-m27	2018-07-12	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 27	12:36	8mm	94x		Modestly bright blurry patch. A bit squarish with a piece taken out on the side. Very nice. :)
20180713-01-m14	2018-07-13	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 14	11:41	8mm	94x		Very faint blur. Can't resolve any stars. hard to see, even after aiming right at it.

20180805-03-m52	2018-08-05	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 52	11:30	5mm	150x		Lots of stars, but most are very dim.  Faint, almost nebulous, with averted vision.
20180805-04-m71	2018-08-05	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 71	11:52	8mm	94x		Very faint; can barely see without averted vision. Just a slightly lighter patch.
20180806-01-m13	2018-08-06	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	2	M 13	11:16	8mm	94x		Large, not very bright. Can see hints of some stars; speckled with averted vision. Yikes (to the transparency and light pollution).
20180806-02-ngc6709	2018-08-06	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	2	NGC 6709	11:29	5mm	150x		Nice bright triangle of stars on the east. Other stars are fairly faint. No central core of stars.
20180807-01-ngc6826	2018-08-07	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	NGC 6826	10:37	5mm	150x		Round and fuzzy, bright in the middle. Does get dimmer when I look straight at it. With 8mm EP, this was even more striking, where it would almost completely disappear with straight vision and get very bright with averted vision. Very cool. :)
20180807-02-m22	2018-08-07	Sammamish HS, Bellevue	Meade Infinity 80	G	3	M 22	11:51	8mm	50x		Fairly large. Faint. Slightly brighter in the center. Hints of stars with averted vision.

20180817-02-ngc654	2018-08-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	NGC 654	11:26	5mm	150x		Hints of more faint stars within the quadrilateral, esp. near the right point, but only have vague glimpses of them.
20180817-03-doublecluster	2018-08-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	NGC 884|NGC 869	11:39	25mm	30x		Spectacular! Stars look like 2 piles of diamonds. NGC 884 (right) looks a bit like a ring, where NGC 864 like a very sparse, fully split globular.

20180827-01-jupiter	2018-08-27	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	2 (dusk)	Jupiter	8:55	5mm	150x		Could easily see two bands, but not time to look very closely as it set behind some trees.
20180827-02-saturn	2018-08-27	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	Saturn	9:06	5mm + 2x barlow	300x		Not too much detail. Can see big gaps between side of Saturn and the rings, and a fain dark gap on the outer part of the rings. Nice shadow on the side of the planet. Some chromatic aberration as indicated.

Outside crater is darker, gradually lightening the farther out you go. White dot in the middle. Lunar rays are white.
20180827-05-byrgiusa	2018-08-27	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	Byrgius A	12:05-12:14	5mm	150x	15 day moon	Byrgius A is bright white. Lunar rays surrounding are light gray, and surrounding area is medium gray.

With more averted vision can see 3 stars, can't see if there are any more.
20180901-04-m110	2018-09-01	Rattlesnake Lake Park	Omni XLT 150	G	7-	M 110	12:08	18mm	42x		See a very faint blur near M 31. Suspect it may be M 110. Very soft, looks taller than wide. Maybe slightly brighter in the core.  The large glow of M 31 is visible in the south of the view.

20180903-04-ngc7662	2018-09-03	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	4	NGC 7662	11:30	5mm	150x		Round, white, concentrated blur. Maybe not as soft as a globular. Slightly brighter in the center.

20181017-01-rupesrecta	2018-10-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Rupes Recta	10:13-10:29	5mm	150x	8 day moon	Rupes Recta (straight wall) is a very prominent vertical line, fairly straight and dark. Thebit has a very dark edge on one side, light on the other. Looks deep. Thebit A looks deep but smaller (bowl-shaped?) Thebit L is very small - just a dot.
20181017-02-delaunay	2018-10-17	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Delaunay	10:33-10:48	5mm	150x	8 day moon	Delaunay looks like it's cloven in two with a hill/mountain across the middle. Top half is dark gray to gray, and the bottom is gray to light gray.

20181018-01-moongammacap	2018-10-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F-P	1	Moon Occultation	9:35-10:55	25mm	30x	9 day moon	Bright haze all around the moon, can't see the dark side.  At 9:38:43, the star just blinks out, instantly gone.  First detected reappearance at 10:33:14. Couldn't detect that Gamma Cap emerged for probably 20-25 seconds from the predicted time since the moon and clouds were so bright. The star was relatively small and dim. Still very cool to see, and the star "moved away" from the moon surprisingly fast.
20181019-01-clavius	2018-10-19	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Clavius	9:53-10:24	5mm	150x	10 day moon	Clavius has a smooth looking interior, with nice chains of craters inside.

20181118-01-lambdaori	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Meade Infinity 80	VG	3	Lambda-Lambda	9:44	25mm	16x		Main feature is a nice right triangle, with a trail of three stars on one edge.
20181118-02-gammacet	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	Gamma Cet	10:05	5mm + 2x barlow	300x		Can see the secondary as a tiny stationary dot of the diffraction rings of the primary.

Trapezium stars have tiny diffraction rings; can't see any other components (E/F). A treat, but a pain to sketch. Theta2 - both white, similarly bright, though star on the left is the primary.
20181118-06-struve747iotaori	2018-11-18	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	VG	3	Struve 747|Iota Ori	11:17	8mm	94x		A,B are Struve 747. A is slightly brighter. Both white. C is iota-Ori, can see much dimmer secondary. All white.  Nice open cluster!

20181206-01-46pwirtanen	2018-12-06	Bellevue at home	Meade Infinity 80	F	3	46P Wirtanen	9:41	25mm	16x		Large, extremely faint circular blur. Slightly brighter -- a hit of a dot -- near the center. A = Azha = Eta Eri.  Had to know exactly where to look for this; wouldn't have seen it otherwise.
20181206-02-thetaaur	2018-12-06	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Theta Aur	11:00	5mm + 2x barlow	300x		All stars somewhat blurry. No obvious color (gray-white). Lots of diffraction mes on the primary.
20181206-03-zetaori	2018-12-06	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	F	3	Zeta Ori	11:25	5mm + 2x barlow	300x		Close secondary appears as a dot in second diffraction ring of the primary. Maybe has a hint of red. Far star is much dimmer.
20181218-01-46pwirtanen	2018-12-18	Bellevue at home	Meade Infinity 80	F	3	46P Wirtanen	7:23	25mm	16x		Very faint fuzzy patch. Center is slightly brighter.  Near Al Kab.

20190711-01-saturn	2019-07-11	Bellevue at home	Meade Infinity 80	F	3	Saturn	11:55	9mm	44x		Tiny and cute. Aww! Yellow. Can't quite make out which part of Saturn is in front of the rings.
20190711-02-jupiter	2019-07-11	Bellevue at home	Meade Infinity 80	F	3	Jupiter	12:07	25mm	16x		Jupiter just a white dot. Moon closest to Jupiter [Io] very hard to see.

20190720-03-bigdipper	2019-07-20	Bellevue at home	Naked Eye	G	3	Big Dipper	11:20				While bright, Megrez is a little hard to see tonight; have to stare at it for a few seconds before I can see it.
20190720-04-herculeskeystone	2019-07-20	Bellevue at home	Naked Eye	G	3	Keystone	11:30				Upper quadrangle is the keystone.
20190720-05-northerncross	2019-07-20	Bellevue at home	Naked Eye	G	3	Northern Cross	11:45				Cygnus completely visible tonight -- often the tips of the wings are hard to see. Many more stars not drawn here.

Deep red, pretty dim also. Weird effect that the triangle originally takes averted vision to see, and U is colorless, but then if I focus on U then other stars disappear and the color on U becomes obvious.
20190727-05-m56	2019-07-27	Bellevue at home	Omni XLT 150	G	3	M 56	12:51	4.5mm	167x		Mostly a gray blur, but can can see some sparkly stars with averted vision, and the core seems brighter. Est class IX.

20190802-01-jupiter	2019-08-02	Bellevue at home	Meade Infinity 80	F-P	3-	Jupiter	9:52	25mm	16x		A bit turbulent, even at this low power.

Mare Australae (Southern Sea): large, uneven shape, wider near the souther side. Separated from the edge of the moon. Gray interior. Proculs: is bright white, with contrasty lunar rays. Golclenius is a bright white ring with gray interior. Mare Humboltatum (Sea of Humboltatum) has somewhat of a D shape. Mare Undarum (Sea of Waves): patchy, darker areas generally the shape of an epsilon.
